We serially inputted the binary sequence 11010000 because it was a good demonstration of bit shifting, since our display could only view four bits at a time. We then also loaded the sequence 10100101 (xA5) with parallel loading.

We used a button to load the preset parallel sequence, switch 0 to set the serial input bit, switch 1 to act as the edge trigger for bit shifting, and switch 2 to switch views between the most and least significant four bits in the sequence.
